# MNIST-AI
The primary AI model is designed to detect handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, and the secondary architecture is adapted to allow for different variations within the dataset, such as flipped or blurred images. Using this two-step approach demonstrates the AI model's ability to handle different situations and improves its efficiency.
